The Issue:
Gun incidents is a significant public health problem in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), there were 39,740 gun deaths in the United States in 2019, the most recent year for which data is available. This includes suicides, homicides, and accidents.

The United States has one of the highest rates of gun ownership in the world, and this is believed to be a major contributing factor to the high rate of gun incidents. Other factors that may contribute to gun incidents include mental illness, access to illegal guns, and a culture of violence.

There is ongoing debate about the best ways to reduce gun incidents in the United States. Some people advocate for stricter gun control laws, while others argue that the right to bear arms is protected by the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and that gun ownership can be a deterrent to crime. It is likely that any solution to the problem of gun incidents will need to address a combination of these factors.

Our Project:

To continue with our previous project on exploring the gun incidents per capita across the USA, our team will be looking at who is affected the most by gun incidents. Gun incidents affects people of all ages, genders, and races in the United States. However, certain groups are at higher risk of being victims of gun incidents. Weâ€™ll be using Machine Learning to identify what those groups look like. Some of the categories will be using will be population density, gender and race/ ethnicity.
